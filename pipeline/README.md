# Model Card

Model cards are a succinct approach for documenting the creation, use, and shortcomings of a model. The idea is to write a documentation such that a non-expert can understand the model card's contents. For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details

## Intended Use

## Training Data

The dataset used in this project is based on individual income in the United States. The *data* is from the *1994 census*, and contains information on an individual's ``marital status, age, type of work, and more``. The target column, or what we want to predict, is whether individuals make *less than or equal to 50k a year*, or *more than 50k a year*.

You can download the data from the University of California, Irvine's [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).

# Project Overview 

In this project, we will apply the skills acquired in the ``Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production`` course to develop a classification model on publicly available Census Bureau data. 

We will create unit tests to monitor the model performance on various slices of the data. Then, we will deploy the final model using the FastAPI package and create API tests. Both the slice-validation and the API tests will be incorporated into a CI/CD framework using GitHub Actions.
